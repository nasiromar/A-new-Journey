# A-new-Journey
The challenge for the first assignment 

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide: I refracterd the code and made the websites structure better than before. I added some closings tags to make the code function easily and also alt attributes. I changed stray .div tags into html elememts. It made the websites hmtl format much stronger because the changes i added didnt break but instead made it function organically as it should always be.

## Table of Contents (Optional)


repository (https://github.com/nasiromar/A-new-Journey)

deployed application (https://nasiromar.github.io/A-new-Journey/)

## Installation

I first cloned the Repository onto my computer. I open the file through termial using "Code ." command. I then made the changes and commited them with git Commit. The messages itself dictats what exactly i had done to the code every commit. I opened up browsers over and over again and used DEV Tools to figure out excatly which html elements/Tags were which. Once i made my changes and accomplished my goals following the User Story and Acceptance criteria; I then pushed my refracterd code to git hub. 

## Usage
open up Vs code
Opened up Dev tools by right clicking on the index.html which opened up the website browser.
Figured out what html elemnts needed changing and what htlm elements belonged where. 
changed a few .divs and swaped them out for elements like Aside,Footer,Header.
Saved my changes and also opened up a browser in html again to see if i broke the code in any way. 
If it did i would undo the mistake and try again until it wouldn't break the code.
Then once i have the code remade in good html structure using the right elements and attributes i git Add -A , git commit,and then i git pushed it up in my repository.
